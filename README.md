This repository has been created to publish the code used to develop the Final Master Project: "Using Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning to detect cyberbullying patterns on Twitter"


The files are in the R folder and are structured as follows:
  - tweets_scrape.R
  - worcloud.R
  - sentiment_analysis.R
  - deeplearning.R
  - reinforcementlearning.R
  
The files have to be executed together and in this order since there are variables defined in a previous scripts that are called later.
